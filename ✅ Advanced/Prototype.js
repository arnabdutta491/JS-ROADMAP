```Description:
The prototype in JavaScript is a mechanism that allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. Every JavaScript object has a prototype, and properties/methods defined on the prototype are shared among all instances of that object type.```

function Person(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  
  // Adding a method to the Person prototype
  Person.prototype.greet = function() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  };
  
  const AD = new Person('AD');
  AD.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is AD
