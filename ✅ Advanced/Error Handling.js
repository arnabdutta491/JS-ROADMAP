```Description:
Error handling in JavaScript allows you to gracefully manage runtime errors or exceptional situations that may occur during the execution of your code. It involves using try, catch, and finally blocks to handle errors.```

try {
    // Code that may throw an error
    throw new Error('Something went wrong');
  } catch (error) {
    // Handling the error
    console.error(error.message);
  } finally {
    // Code to be executed regardless of whether an error occurred
    console.log('Cleanup code here');
  }
